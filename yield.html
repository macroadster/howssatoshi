        <p>Imagine Bitcoin's network is a massive factory. This factory's job is to create new bitcoins and process transactions. The "Dollars Yield Per kWh" is a way of measuring how much value that factory produces for every unit of electricity it consumes.</p><br>

        <p>It takes the total dollar value of all the new bitcoins produced in a day and divides it by the total amount of energy used by all the computers in the network during that same period.</p><br>

        <p>This metric helps us understand the "return on energy" for Bitcoin. A higher number means that the network is generating more dollar value for each unit of power it uses. It's a way to think about the economic efficiency of the system, separate from traditional financial metrics like market capitalization.</p>
